# Exercise 2: Comparing data to predictions

In this week's exercise we will work on comparing observations (data) to predictions.
In particular, we will explore three different ways in which we can compare data to a prediction:

1. Fitting a line to *x-y* data using the *least squares regression*
2. Calculating *linear correlation coefficients* between two variables
3. Comparing observed values to expected values using a *goodness-of-fit* equation

All three of these cases are frequently used, and can even be calculated in commonly used software such as **Microsoft Excel**.
Our goal is to understand what the numbers from these "fits" mean and *how* they are calculated.
